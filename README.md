# Assembly-RPN-Calculator

A simple assembly based “Reverse Polish Notation” (RPN) calculator.
This calculator receives two hexadecimal numbers as inputs, and then performs
one of 4 user selected operations on them: 

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication or Division.

The code was written, compiled, and tested in the PicoBlaze IDE targeting the PicoBlaze 3 as
the emulated hardware.
